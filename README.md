# ColorJump Game
ColorJump is a video game what created on Unity 3D. That endless-run game has basic mechanics. You only have to do is "Dont Touch The Red Ground". You can move your character left or right when you jump if you stay on ground you cant move your character. I hope it will be a funny game when i finished. I still work on it. There are some photos from my game.
