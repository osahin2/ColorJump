# ColorJump Game
ColorJump is a video game what created on Unity 3D. That endless-run game has basic mechanics. You only have to do is "Dont Touch The Red Ground". You can move your character left 
or right when you jump if you stay on ground you cant move your character. I hope it will be a funny game when i finished. I still work on it. In the future i want to add game 
mobile controls with pointer events, want to implement swipe mechanics. I want to share this on play store so on this project i will experience about ads.



There are some photos from my game.
